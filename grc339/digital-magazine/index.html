                                <p>
                                    In 1967, a pivotal year in the anti-war movement, a remarkable collection of 16 works emerged, encapsulating the spirit of resistance and the power of artistic and literary expression. This collection, a poignant testament to the era, not only reflects the sentiments of its time but also stands as a lasting testament to the enduring connection between art, literature, and activism.
